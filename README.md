# Stellar Activity Taxonomy

This repository contains the data and source code (analysis pipeline) used in the study on stellar activity taxonomy. The main objective of this project is to analyze and classify different types of stellar activities based on physical indices and parameters.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* **`principal.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the entire data analysis flow. It includes:
    * Data loading and processing.
    * Calculation of statistics and correlations.
    * Generation of plots and visualizations presented in the study.
* **`table2.csv`, `table3.csv`, `table4.csv`**: CSV data files containing stellar parameters and activity indices. These files correspond to the tables presented in the original publication/work.
* **`figures/`**: Directory dedicated to storing figures generated by the notebook.

## 🚀 How to Use

To reproduce the analysis or explore the data, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

You will need **Python 3** and **Jupyter Notebook** installed. The main libraries used in the analysis likely include:

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `scipy`
* `seaborn` (if applicable for visualization)

### Installation and Execution

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rrf-astro/stellar-activity-taxonomy_2025.git](https://github.com/rrf-astro/stellar-activity-taxonomy_2025.git)
    cd stellar-activity-taxonomy_2025
    ```

2.  Install dependencies (manually or via requirements if available):
    ```bash
    pip install notebook pandas matplotlib numpy scipy
    ```

3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook principal.ipynb
    ```

4.  Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## 📊 About the Data

The provided tables (`tableX.csv`) contain processed data essential for the proposed taxonomy. Ensure they are in the same directory as the notebook to guarantee correct loading.
